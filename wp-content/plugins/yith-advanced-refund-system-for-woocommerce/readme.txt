Meanwhile, you can set the request to this status. "On hold" is designed to inform customers that the request is paused due to a third party, not controllable by you.

= Does the plugin manage refunds with taxes? =
Yes, if your shop works with taxes, you can easily make refunds with taxes included.

= Can a customer write me messages endlessly? =
When you approve or reject a request, you are able to close the request and disable new message option on the request.
